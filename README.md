# Enhancing Bank Marketing with Machine Learning

🏦 A machine learning project applying KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees & Random Forest to optimize bank marketing campaigns and predict customer term deposit subscriptions.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project uses real-world bank marketing data from a Portuguese financial institution to build and compare five supervised learning models. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on features such as demographics, job status, campaign history, and contact duration.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset  
- Records: 56,373
- Target variable: y (yes/no – whether the client subscribed to a term deposit)

## ⚙️ Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE
- Model training & evaluation using:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Hyperparameter tuning

## 🧪 Key Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| 90.5%    | ...       | ...    | ...      |
| KNN                | ...      | ...       | ...    | ...      |
| SVM                | ...      | ...       | ...    | ...      |
| Decision Tree      | ...      | ...       | ...    | ...      |
| Random Forest      | ...      | ...       | ...    | ...      

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- SMOTE helped address the dataset's class imbalance.
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression showed promising predictive performance.
- Shorter call durations and previous outcomes were highly predictive features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
